Note: 
- Bets were observed around 4pm (qualifying already happened, earlier in the day). At roughly 11:43pm, the odds across all sites were the same as they were at 4pm.
- Throughout the race the bets were the same as the day before when recorded (this is on Bet MGM)

Top 3 bets have better payout becasue of lower chance compared to top 6 and top 10 bets. 

do 1/decimal to get implied probability
negative odds (favorites): prob = |odds|/|odds| + 100
pos odds (underdogs): prob = 100/odds + 100

If driver model prob < implied prob (from betting markets) don't bet b/c neg EV
else if driver model prob > implied prob bet b/c pos EV

Tested how much the odds go down. For Spanish GP, around 2/3 days before qualifying odds for top 3 were 1.36,1.36,1.44. After qual odds went down to 1.10,1.12,1.36. Some driver's also went up quite a lot, like Leclerc went from 2.50 --> 9.00. So safest time to make a bet is after Qual.
