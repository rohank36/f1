meeting_id, session_id 

Are team results in 2015 predictive of team results today when the car and drivers are different? Not predicative.

historical years to look at: 2022-2024. 2022 new regulations came in. 

*****
issue: some drivers have more historical data than others, how to bridge gap for newer drivers.
- f2 comparable to f1? don't use f2 data for rookies. 
- maybe use practice data only for rookies
- rookies only have 2025 data, so what to use for test set? 
--> Each rookie inherits their team's average performance (e.g. mean qualifying position, race finish etc). Figure out a way to make this reasonable. As most of the time a rookie won't be able to live up to past average performances of the team.

for predicting in sports, how to use historical data? When in the past the team/driver may have been completely different? 
--> include year in row (encoded)

might have to lag to get proper autoregressive modelling? because you want to capture how peoples past performances impact current ones. e.g. MOMENTUM. Look into how to do this more.
--> Use exponentially weighted average of past 3-5 races to capture their performance over time for different features. 

Figure out what you want your model to output for the race rankings. 
*****

when weather=wet/rainy, driver 80% team 20% . Else driver 20% car 40% team 40%.  

don't need to use practice times. Qualifying/Sprints and Race data most important. 

Number of stints + compounds used = strategy 

stint = portion of the race on specific tire

SOFT = flying but short duration 
MED = both
HARD = slowest but longest duration
Certain circuits have tires that are better than others. 

Must have at least 1 pitstop during race and must change tire compound 

Methodology:
- understand data, build out dataset
- build end to end pipeline with easy dumb baselines
- overfit on training data
- regularize (heavy regularization will be needed due to small num of examples but relatively high num of features)
- tune

historical data --> 1 day before race, make the prediction. Predict race finishing positions (maybe just look at top 10 and predict it super welll, reasoning = rookies will mostly be outside of top 10 and we don't have much data on them ) 

after basic predictive model is built, look into building a hedge/risk model to optimize betting placements (take inspiration from financial hedging/risk models)




#### Training Notes

removing location feature, did not really impact model 1. Raised training acc of model 2 to 100% did not affect val acc. 

removing ["Event_Type","Sprint_Qual_Position","Sprint_Race_Position"] negatively impacted val performance for both m1 and m2. Didn't affect training acc.
